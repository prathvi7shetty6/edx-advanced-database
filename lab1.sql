2)Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each category that has products with these columns:

The category_name column from the Categories table
The count of the products in the Products table aliased as product_count
The list price of the most expensive product in the Products table aliased as most_expensive_product

3) Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these columns:

The email_address column from the Customers table
The sum of the item price in the Order_Items table multiplied by the quantity in the Order_Items table aliased as item_price_total
The sum of the discount amount column in the Order_Items table multiplied by the quantity in the Order_Items table aliased as discount_amount_total

4)Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these columns:

The total amount for each order aliased as order_total (Hint: First, subtract the discount amount from the price. Then, multiply by the quantity.)
Return only those rows where the customer has more than 1 order.

5) Modify the solution to lab 4 so it only counts and totals line items that have an item_price value thatâ€™s greater than 400.

Here are the directions for lab 4:
Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these columns:

The email_address column from the Customers table
A count of the number of orders aliased as order_count
The total amount for each order aliased as order_total (Hint: First, subtract the discount amount from the price. Then, multiply by the quantity.)
Return only those rows where the customer has more than 1 order.
Sort the result set in descending sequence by the sum of the line item amounts.

SUM((item_price - discount_amount) * quantity) AS OrderTotal

JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

WHERE item_price > 400
GROUP BY email_address
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 1
ORDER BY OrderTotal DESC
